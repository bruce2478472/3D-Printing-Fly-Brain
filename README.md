# 3D-Printing-Fly-Brain
I did my dissertation with Professor Douglas Armstrong (of the Armstrong Group) and Dr Adam Stokes (of the Stokes Research Group) in 3D printing a modular model of the fly brain using real bioinformatics; gaining experience with Autodesk CAD and 3D printing as applied to structural biological data.

The problem is that fly brain structure is complicated and I proposed that using 3D printing we could create a physical model, enagaging tactile interaction, and allowing easier learning of the structure. My project investigated the viability and limitations of creating such a model.
